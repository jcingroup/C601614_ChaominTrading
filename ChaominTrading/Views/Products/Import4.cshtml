            <p>Perilla leaves are often translated from Korean as “sesame leaves,” which is technically a correct translation although they aren’t related to the sesame plant. They look a little similar to Japanese shiso leaves but taste very different and are larger, flatter, have a less serrated edge, and are a little purple on the underside. They are a member of the mint family.</p>
