            <p>Asparagus is long, slender vegetables that grow as shoots. The straight, firm stalks, which range from pencil thin to as thick as your thumb, are prized for their delicate flavor; the tender tips have a particularly delicate flavor and texture.The most common variety is green and sometimes tinged with purple at the bud.Trim the stalks before using. Cut or snap off the tough ends and discard.</p>
